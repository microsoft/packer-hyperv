The files **packer-builder-hyperv-iso.exe** and **packer-provisioner-powershell.exe** in the archive are Packer plug-ins. 

How to install plug-ins you can find here: http://www.packer.io/docs/extend/plugins.html

As the plug-ins names follow new Packer plug-in convention - the simplest way to install the plug-ins just download them into your Packer folder.

The file **packer-post-processor-vagrant.exe** is an extention of the original file with the same name to create a vagrant box from a Hyper-V atrifact.
